Hello-World
===========

My First Branch!

Im in coolage, I've gotten my feet wet in programming.
I love creative thinking and I love pushing ideas around a table.
I'm currently focused on college but my interest for computers will never fade.
I plan on creating things for the open-source community.

Given time, I'll always find my way back.
